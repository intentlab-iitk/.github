# Welcome to INTENT Labs!

At INTENT Labs we focuse on fundamental and applied research in intelligent networks. Our mission is to develop novel techniques and algorithms to address the challenges of next-generation networking problems. We leverage Reinforcement Learning, machine learning, and network science to create intelligent and adaptive network systems.

INTENT Lab is affiliated with the Electrical Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur), under the guidence of [Dr. Subrahmanya Swamy Peruru](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~swamyp/).

üìç **Location**: You can find us at 408E, nestled within the Advanced Centre for Electronics Systems (ACES) at IIT Kanpur.

## Research Areas
- Intelligent routing algorithms
- Reinforcement learning for network optimization
- Network security

Let's innovate together and shape the future of networking!
